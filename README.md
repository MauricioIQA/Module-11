## Summary

The table on webpage can filter the UFO data by 'Date', 'City', 'State', 'Country' and 'Shape'.

Drawback
The page cannot have a option to back the full table.

Futher Development
In the future, the further work could have:

Adding a "add button" that client can add new data into table.
Adding a "delete button" that client can delete some data of table from dataset.
Adding a sorting option for table.
