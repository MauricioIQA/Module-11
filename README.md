# Module-11
UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a Dynamic web page that filters data of UFO's sightings. 


## Results

As we can see in the following image, we just need to input our preferences and the table will be updated instantly.

## Summary

The table we have created in our webpage filters the UFO data by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

We might encounter countless drawbacks here, the thing is that every user would like something from this page according to their needs, if we have to point one of them is that maybe the inputs could be displayed as options, in that way the user wouldn't be guessing dates. 

We could think of 3 improvements, the user being able to add new data, to save preferences of city and state, and to set preferences of how the data is being filtered.
